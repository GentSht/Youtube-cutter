# Youtube-cutter

This is a desktop application that permits the download of youtube videos in a mp3 or a mp4 format. You can also choose timestamps to cut a sequence from that video.
The GUI was done with Tkinter (and ttkbootstrap) and the downloading and cutting are performed using yt-dlp and ffmepg respectively.
